![Baana Predictions](src/static/title.png)

Baana predictions is a service for predicting the number of cyclist using Baana cycling route today and tomorrow each day. The service has been [running on Heroku](https://baana-predictions.herokuapp.com) since 13Th February 2016 as a course work for a practical machine learning corse at the University of Helsinki.

The predictions are made using a linear machine learning classifier trained with cyclist counts and weather information since 1.1.2013. The weather information and forecasts come from Finnish Meteorological Institution [open data service](//en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data) and the cyclist counts are provided by Helsingin Kaupunkisuunnitteluvirasto through [avoindata.fi](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/fi/dataset/helsingin-pyorailijamaarat), with the most recent data taken from [InfraControl barometer](http://www1.infracontrol.com/cykla/barometer/barometer_fi.asp?system=helsinki&mode=day).
